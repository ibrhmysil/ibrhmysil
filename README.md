### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ibrhmysil/ibrhmysil** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Hardware Design, Software Development, and R&D
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative projects!
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with new project ideas.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: simply with @ibrhmysil username many platforms!
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: YeÅŸil (yes it is a color, green..)
- âš¡ Fun fact: If github were an ocean, I would be a water molecule (not even a drop).
